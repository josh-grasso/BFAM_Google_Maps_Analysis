# BFAM_Google_Maps_Analysis
The aim of this project is to provide real-time insight into the post-COVID re-opening of Bright Horizons' network of daycare centers by leveraging the Google Maps API. These insights include two main parameters: the number of locations that have been "permanently closed" - informing forecasts of BFAM's revenue returning to pre-COVID levels - and the number of locations that are "operational" as compared to "temoporarily closed" - informing near-term (current quarter and +1 quarter) financial forecasts. These insights lower risk/uncertainty regarding the current status of the business, regardless of opinion of the future trajectory of a re-opening.
